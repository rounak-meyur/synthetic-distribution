# Synthetic Distribution
## Motivation
Physical inter-dependencies between networked civil infrastructures such as transportation and power system network are well known. In order to analyze complex non-linear co-relations between such networks, datasets pertaining to such real infrastructures are required. Such data are not readily available due to their sensitive nature. The aim of this project is to generate realistic synthetic distribution network for a given geographical region. The generated network is not the actual distribution system but is very similar to the real distribution network. The synthetic network connects high voltage substations to individual residential consumers through primary and secondary distribution networks. The distribution network is generated by solving an optimization problem which minimizes the overall length of network and is subject to the usual structural and power flow constraints. The network generation algorithm is applied to create synthetic distribution networks in Montgomery county of south-west Virginia, USA.

## Datasets used
**Roads** The road network represented in the form of a graph <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\mathcal{R}=(\mathcal{V}_\mathcal{R},\mathcal{L}_\mathcal{R})">, where <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\mathcal{V}_\mathcal{R}"> and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\mathcal{L}_\mathcal{R}"> are respectively the sets of nodes and links of the network. Each road link <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=l\in\mathcal{L}_\mathcal{R}"> is represented as an unordered pair of terminal nodes <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=(u,v)"> with <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=u,v\in\mathcal{V}_\mathcal{R}">. Each road node has a spatial embedding in form of longitude and latitude. Therefore each node <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=v\in\mathcal{V}_\mathcal{R}"> can be represented in two dimensional space as <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\mathbf{p_v}\in\mathbb{R}^2">. Similarly, a road link <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=l=(u,v)"> can be represented as a vector <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\mathbf{p_u}-\mathbf{p_v}">.
	
**Substations** The set of substations <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\mathsf{S}=\{s_1,s_2,\cdots,s_M\}">, where the area consists of $M$ substations and their respective geographical location data. Each substation can be represented by a point in the 2-D space as $\mathbf{p_s}\in\mathbb{R}^2$.
	
**Residences** The set of residential buildings with geographical coordinates $\mathsf{H}=\{h_1,h_2,\cdots,h_N\}$, where the area consists of $N$ home locations. Each residential building can be represented by a point in the 2-D space as $\mathbf{p_h}\in\mathbb{R}^2$.
