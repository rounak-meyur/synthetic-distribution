realistic interdependent infrastructures
	distrubtion system from the substation to individual customers
	optimal network generation to minimize the cost of installing lines, substation feeders
	generate networks which are most likely to be designed by power distribution companies
radial configuration: NP-hard problem and can be solved in linear time with certain formulations
	single commodity flow approach
	compute all possible cycles
	forest is a subset of trees
large scale network generation able to be solved in small time
	large area divided into small areas through Voronoi cells
