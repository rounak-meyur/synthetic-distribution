\section{Prior Works}
Previous works by Overbye et al.~\cite{overbye_101,overbye_102} propose methods to generate synthetic transmission network which bear topological and geographical resemblance with a real power system. At first, a statistical study is performed to estimate the per capita power consumption. This, along with the population information from the US Census data is used to estimate the real/reactive power demand at each ZIP code center which is considered to be locations of load substations. This estimated value is used as the substation load and voltage is assigned based on typical values present in the geographic region. Generator location and capacity data obtained from the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) is used to identify locations of generator substations. Thereafter, a Delaunay Triangulation method is used to connect the generator and load substations while maintaining the statistical aspects of a real power system network at the same time. However, these works lack methods to generate multiple number of such realistic synthetic networks. Furthermore, the models aggregate the distribution system to a load substation with an aggregated load value. In our work, we present a method to generate realistic synthetic distribution networks in as much detail as possible.
